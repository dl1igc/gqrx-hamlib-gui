Installation
------------
This version is written for Python3. The biggest difference being that the xml-rpc library used to communicate with fldigi was renamed between Python2 and Python3.

Install PyQt4 for Python3 via your package manager if not already installed: sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt4

Install gqrxHamlib using the Python3 pip installer: sudo pip3 install gqrxHamlib

Run gqrxHamlib: type 'gqrxHamlib' at command prompt
